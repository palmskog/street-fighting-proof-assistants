# Street-Fighting Proof Assistants

Educational materials for practical use of proof assistants to get things done.

Part 1: Gallina programming

Part 2: Imp programming

Part 3: "ML" programming

Points of emphasis:
* Understanding reasoning based on *computation*
  * building an accurate mental model for Coq's interpreter ("definitional
    equality")
* Knowing when to think; knowing when to grind
* Developing good proof engineering habits
* How to find good induction hypotheses
  * starting from thing that you want to prove, derive lemma that implies it and
    is provable by induction
* Actually running programs
  * from gallina
  * from deeply embedded DSL
  * design and implementation of trusted shims
